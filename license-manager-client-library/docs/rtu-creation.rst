================================

As an admin role in the platform you will have access to the RTU configuration view.
This feature applies to models with commercial / not open source SPDX licenses.
To enable this feature you must be using portal with Security verification enabled:

.. code-block:: json

  SPRING_APPLICATION_JSON: '{
          "portal": {
            "feature": {
              "sv": {
                "enabled": "true",
                "api": "http://sv-scanning-service:9082/scan"
              },
            },
  }'

rtu id per solution. Each RTU can be either a Site Wide RTU (any user doesn't matter when

User-specific RTU
-----------------

For a User specific RTU you can select any user you find.
You do not need to select the model owner. The RTU check will not
be made for the owner of the model. For federated models the owner is 
the admin account that subscribed to the models.

Select a User or set of Users - Note - you may need to scroll the grid to see more users.

Please make sure you inform the user outside of Acumos platform.
