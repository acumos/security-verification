	 * Webhooks can be configured in NexusIQ server https://help.sonatype.com/iqserver/iq-server-webhooks
	 * Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that POST data to defined URLs. They let you build integrations registered to certain events on IQ Server. When a registered event is triggered, an HTTP POST payload is sent to the webhookâ€™s defined URL.

Use webhooks to receive notifications about events that happen in IQ Server. When an event occurs - for example, when an application evaluation is completed - IQ Server creates an event object. This object has relevant information about what just happened, such as the type of event and any data associated with the event. IQ Server then sends the event object to defined URLs using HTTP POST requests.

IQ Server lets you use webhooks for policy management, application evaluation, security vulnerability override management, and license override management events.

Each webhook is defined by the following:

The URL to POST the payload.
An optional secret key that ensures authenticity of the source.
Event types subscribed by the webhook.
