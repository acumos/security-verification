      "message": "Why do we need 777 permissions for entire maven folder? I am confused why you need to give world writable access to this directory. \n\nAlso the jira doesn\u0027t describe the issue just the fix. The logs directory is a volume so not sure why we are not describing it as a volume \n\nI believe /maven/logs is a mounted volume based on docker compose and kubernetes setup in system-integration. Maybe we should be using VOLUME directive in docker vs mkdir",

      "message": "Some processes write files in the local directory, not just to the logs subdirectory; that is only possible for a non-root user if the directory is writable.\n\nThe /maven/logs area varies by deployment.  In our azure dev labs, we use the docker-compose volume feature, which is what the docker peeps recommend; the permissions are set inside the container, not by the volume. In contrast, the AIO uses bind mounts to expose a linux filesystem, and that filesystem sets the permissions.",
