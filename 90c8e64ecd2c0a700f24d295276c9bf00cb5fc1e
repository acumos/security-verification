      "message": "Why do we need 777 permissions for entire maven folder? I am confused why you need to give world writable access to this directory. \n\nAlso the jira doesn\u0027t describe the issue just the fix. The logs directory is a volume so not sure why we are not describing it as a volume \n\nI believe /maven/logs is a mounted volume based on docker compose and kubernetes setup in system-integration. Maybe we should be using VOLUME directive in docker vs mkdir",
